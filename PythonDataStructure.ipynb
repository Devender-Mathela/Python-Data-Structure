What are data structures, and why are they important?\n","Ans: Data structures are organized ways to store and manage data (e.g., lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets). They are important because they allow efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, which improves performance and solves problems effectively.\n","\n","\n","Q2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n","Ans:\n","\n","Mutable: Mutable data types Can be changed after creation. Example: list = [1, 2, 3] -> list[0] = 10 is allowed.\n","\n","Immutable:Immutable data types Cannot be changed after creation. Example: tuple = (1, 2, 3)->tuple[0] = 10(error).\n","\n","\n","Q3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","Ans:\n","\n","List:Lists are Mutable, slower and it is declared by using square brackets []. Ex: [1,2,3,4]\n","\n","Tuple:Tuples are Immutable, faster and it is declared by using parentheses (). Ex: (1,2,3,4)\n","\n","\n","Q4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n","Ans:\n","\n","Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs using a hash table. Example: {\"name\": \"Alex\", \"age\": 25} here, \"name\" is the key, \"Alex\" is the value.\n","\n","\n","Q5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","Ans:\n","\n","Sets stores the unique value and it  automatically remove duplicate values and allow fast membership checks, making them useful for uniqueness and faster lookups.\n","\n","\n","Q6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","Ans:\n","\n","String:Strings are the Immutable sequence of characters (\"hello\").\n","\n","List:Lists are the Mutable sequence of elements (['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']).\n","\n","Strings cannot be modified directly, while lists can i.e string is immutable whereas list is mutable data type.\n","\n","\n","Q7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","Ans:\n","\n","Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their values cannot be changed. This prevents accidental modification and ensures data safety.\n","\n","\n","Q8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","Ans:\n","\n","A hash table stores data in key-value pairs using a hash function for quick access. Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n","Ans:\n","\n","Strings are immutable because changing them would require creating a new string object in memory. This ensures efficiency, security, and consistency.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","Ans:\n","\n","Dictionaries provide:\n","\n","-Faster lookups using keys (O(1) average time).\n","\n","-Better readability by naming elements (data[\"age\"]) instead of using indexes.\n","\n","-It store the values using hash table hence fasster accessible\n","\n","\n","\n","Q12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","Ans:\n","\n","When storing fixed data that should not change, e.g., coordinates (x, y) or days of the week. where we don't want to alter the value after creaing it.\n","\n","\n","Q13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","Ans:\n","\n","Sets automatically remove duplicates value. Example: {1, 2, 2, 3} â†’ {1, 2, 3}.\n","\n","\n","Q15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n","Ans:\n","\n","No, tuples are immutable data type. Once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n","\n","\n","Q16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n","Ans:\n","\n","A nested dictionary is a dictionary inside another dictionary.\n","Example:\n","\n","student = {\n","  \"name\": \"Alice\",\n","  \"marks\": {\"math\": 90, \"science\": 85}\n","}\n","\n","\n","\n","Q17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n","Ans:\n","\n","Dictionary access is O(1) average time due to hashing, but can degrade to O(n) in rare cases of hash collisions.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","Ans:\n","\n","-When order matters.\n","\n","-When you only need a sequence of values without unique keys.\n","\n","-For operations requiring indexing.\n","\n","\n","Q19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","Ans:\n","\n","Dictionaries (before Python 3.7) didn't guarantee order because they use hashing. In modern Python (3.7+), they preserve insertion order, but retrieval is still by key, not by position.\n","\n","\n","\n","Q20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","Ans:\n","\n","List: Retrieve by index -> list[2].\n","\n","Dictionary: Retrieve by key -> dict[\"name\"].\n","\n","Dictionaries are faster for lookups when using meaningful keys.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"nz9oTcEzN0vM"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Practical Question\n","#Q1.
